Thanks for your interest in my rstudio::conf 2022 talk! 

The slides will be available here and I'll post my video recording once RStudio puts it up on YouTube.

## Resources

The best place for most people who want to start out with their own consulting business is the podcast [The Business of Authority](https://www.thebusinessofauthority.com/). It talks about things like finding your niche, marketing, and much more. I'd start at the begining of the podcast.

The book I have found most helpful in thinking about marketing is [Storybrand by Donald Miller](https://www.amazon.com/Building-StoryBrand-Clarify-Message-Customers/dp/0718033329). The subtitle ("Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen") gives a good idea of what it's about.

Another good book is the [Tiny MBA by Alex Hillman](https://stackingthebricks.com/tinymba/). It's got bite-sized lessons on business.
