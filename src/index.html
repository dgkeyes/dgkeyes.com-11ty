  <p>You probably know me as the founder of <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com">R for the Rest of Us.</a>
  </p>
  <p>I love R now, but <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/04/my-r-journey-david-keyes/">I had a really hard time learning it.</a>
  </p>
  <p>That's why I love helping others avoid the pain I experienced.</p>
